# STORJPebble
A simple storj node monitoring app for pebble

## Adding your own Storj node
To add your own storj node replace the two strings to your wanted storj node id and nickname
```
{id: 'ff67240e523fc15e2fbdf4caeed8421840e0f71c', nick: 'NAS'}
```

## The future
I am right now implementing support for multiple nodes, any help would be greatly appreciated!

- [ ] Multiple nodes
- [ ] Configurable using clay
