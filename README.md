# STORJPebble
A simple storj node monitoring app for pebble

## Adding your own Storj node
Just open the pebble app and configure the app!

## The future
I am right now implementing support for multiple nodes, any help would be greatly appreciated!

- [ ] Multiple nodes
- [x] Configurable using clay
